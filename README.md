# 8085 Simulator Android App

## Overview

The 8085 Simulator Android App is a powerful tool for anyone interested in programming and microprocessors. Developed using Android Studio and Java, this app emulates the 8085 microprocessor, allowing users to run programs using assembly-level language, just like programming a real 8085 microprocessor. In addition to its simulation capabilities, the app also provides the valuable feature of detecting compilation errors.

## Key Features

- **8085 Microprocessor Emulation:** The app accurately simulates the behavior of the 8085 microprocessor, providing a realistic environment for programming and learning.
- **Assembly-Level Language Support:** Users can write and run programs using assembly-level language, similar to programming a physical 8085 microprocessor.
- **Error Detection:** The app identifies compilation errors, helping users troubleshoot and improve their code efficiently.
- **Android Studio and Java:** Developed using Android Studio and Java, ensuring a robust and user-friendly experience for Android users.
